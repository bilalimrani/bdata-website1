      OT, IT , IoT / edge devices, as well as cloud instances, are particularly
      susceptible to cyber attacks if any of the ports on the device are left
      open. This can provide a pathway for hackers to gain unauthorized access
      to the system. Managing all the ports on these devices can be a
      challenging task for companies, especially when dealing with a large
      number of devices.
      <br />
      The BIoT security technology binary solution provides companies with a way
      to remotely enable or disable ports on their devices as needed. This
      allows them to easily manage the security of their devices by ensuring
      that only the necessary ports are open at any given time.
      <br />
      For example, if a device is only being used to transmit data and does not
      require remote access, the BIoT binary solution can be used to disable the
      port that would normally be used for remote access. This eliminates the
      risk of hackers exploiting that port to gain unauthorized access to the
      device.
      <br />
      Overall, the BIoT binary solution provides companies with a powerful tool
      for managing the security of their IoT and edge devices and cloud
      instances by allowing them to remotely enable or disable ports as needed.
      This helps to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and makes it easier for
      companies to manage the security of their devices.
