      BIoT security technology provides malware detection for OT infrastructure
      involving identifying and mitigating malicious software as per MITRE that
      can compromise the security of industrial control systems (ICS) and other
      types of OT systems. This can include malware specifically designed to
      target ICS and SCADA systems, as well as more general types of malware
      that can be used to gain unauthorized access to the systems.

          Packages monitoring: BIoT technology enables customers to monitor all
          the softwares , packages , middleware, services running on the devices
          and continuously monitor with respect to the MITRE database to detect
          any predetermined malware within the customer network.
        </li>

          Behavior-based detection: BIoT technology enables customers to have
          machine learning based anomaly detection by identifying a piece of
          software to see if it matches the characteristics of known malware.
          This can include monitoring network traffic, system calls, and other
          types of system activity.

          Network traffic analysis: BIoT security technology enables customers
          to have network traffic analysis which is used to detect malware by
          monitoring the traffic on the OT network for signs of malicious
          activity. This includes monitoring for unusual patterns of traffic,
          such as large amounts of data being transferred to or from a single IP
          address, or for specific types of network packets that are associated
          with malware.
