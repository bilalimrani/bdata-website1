      The BIoT platform dashboard is a centralized tool that allows
      organizations to monitor and analyze data from sensors, devices, or
      systems that are located in remote or hard-to-reach locations. The data is
      transmitted to a central location in real-time, allowing for continuous
      monitoring and analysis.
      <br />
      Telemetry, the process of collecting and transmitting data from remote
      sources, is commonly used across a wide range of industries, including
      aerospace, transportation, and healthcare. This technology allows
      organizations to gather real-time data from equipment, vehicles, or other
      assets, which can then be used to improve performance, safety, and
      efficiency.
      <br />
      The BIoT platform dashboard provides a single, unified view of all the
      data collected from telemetry systems, making it easier to identify
      trends, patterns and anomalies. This information can be used to optimize
      operations, reduce downtime, improve equipment and systems performance,
      and increase the overall efficiency of an organization.
      <br />
      Additionally, the BIoT platform dashboard can also be integrated with
      other systems such as SCADA, PLC, DCS and with security systems like
      intrusion detection and prevention, firewall management, and endpoint
      protection, providing a more comprehensive view of the organization's
      security posture.
      <br />
      The BIoT platform dashboard is a powerful tool that allows organizations
      to collect, monitor, and analyze data from remote and hard-to-reach
      locations, enabling them to improve performance, safety, and efficiency
      across a wide range of industries.
