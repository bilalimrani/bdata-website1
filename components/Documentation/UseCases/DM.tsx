      The BIoT security platform enables customers to effectively manage their
      connected devices, also known as edge devices. This process, known as
      device management, encompasses a wide range of tasks including
      administering, configuring, maintaining, and troubleshooting these
      devices.
      <br />
      Device management is a crucial aspect of IT, OT, and IoT infrastructure
      management as it helps to ensure that devices are secure, reliable, and
      performing at optimal levels. The BIoT security platform provides a
      comprehensive set of tools to manage devices, including the ability to
      remotely configure and update devices, monitor device health and
      performance, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
      <br />
      The platform also allows for the management of devices at scale, including
      the ability to deploy software updates and security patches to multiple
      devices simultaneously. This greatly reduces the time and effort required
      to maintain and troubleshoot devices.
      <br />
      Additionally, the BIoT security platform provides advanced security
      features that help to protect devices from cyber threats such as malware,
      ransomware, and unauthorized access. This includes the use of machine
      immutable fingerprint based authentication, which ensures that only
      authorized devices can access the network, and end-to-end encryption,
      which helps to protect data transmitted between devices.
      <br />
      In summary, the BIoT security platform provides a comprehensive set of
      tools for managing devices, including the ability to remotely configure,
      monitor and troubleshoot devices, deploy software updates, and security
      patches, and implement advanced security features to protect devices from
      cyber threats. This helps to ensure that devices are secure, reliable and
      performing optimally, which is crucial for IT, OT and IoT infrastructure
      management.
